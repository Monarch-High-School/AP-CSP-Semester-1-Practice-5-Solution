# AP CSP - Semester 1 Practice 5

## Task
In the file `hello_you.py`, write a program in Python that prompts the user for their name, and then greets them following the exact ouput below. The prompt does not need to match, but the greeting will need to match.

```
Hello, what is your name? xxxx
Hello, xxxx! It is nice to meet you.
```
Note: `xxxx` is whatever the user enters.

In the `REFLECTIONS.md` file, answer the reflection questions using complete sentences.

## Assessment
When you commit your file, automatic tests will run and try a series of inputs to your program. For this program, the 
inputs will be different names.
